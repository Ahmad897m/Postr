            <span class="history">Last updated: Mar 13, 2024 </span>
            <p>Thank you for choosing Postr ("us", "we", or "our"). This Privacy Policy ("Policy") explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your personal information when you use our software and related services (collectively, the "Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to the practices described in this Policy. If you do not agree with this Policy, please refrain from using the Service.</p>

        <div class="part1">
            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>1.1. <span> Personal Information</span>: When you register an account or use certain features of the Service, we may collect personal information, such as your name, email address, and other contact details.</p>
            <p>1.2. <span> Usage Data </span>: We may automatically collect information about your interactions with the Service, such as your IP address, browser type, device information, pages visited, and the time and date of your visits.</p>
            <p>1.3. <span> Cookies and Similar Technologies</span>: We may use cookies, beacons, and other tracking technologies to collect information about your preferences and usage patterns. You can control the use of cookies through your browser settings.</p>
            <p>1.4. <span> If you register through social logins</span>: You can register using your account on the social network whose social login is active in **Postr** for this purpose. In that case, the corresponding social network will provide us with your email, your profile picture, and your name with a Unique Identifier associated with your Administrator profile in Postr.</p>
            <p>You must log into that social network and accept the permissions that you grant Postr through it.</p>
            <p>Postr requests permission to access the APIs provided by social networks and other information providers such as Google API, Meta API, Pinterest API, TikTok API, X API, LinkedIn API, Mastodon API, and more. Postr will access the information required by the user through the authorized APIs. This information will be processed solely for the benefit of the administrator and will not be shared with third parties. The administrator can revoke the permissions directly from the social network or the data provider without accessing your Postr account.</p>
            <p>Postrâ€™s use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements.</p>
